Supposedly a GIS Analyst at the British Red Cross, though I can't remember the last time I actually made a map. I spend the majority of my time supporting SIMS responses in various ways and have been involved with the remote support for Nigeria complex emergency, Iraq population movement and Bangladesh floods, amongst others. I am currently looking to improve my own and Red Cross Movement information management support for cash transfer programmes.
